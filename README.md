# ProbProg-COVID-19

Project aims to simulate COVID-19 virus spread across the globe using Probabilistic Programming.

STEPS:

1. Get the virus statistic by the Virus-model --> 

2. Infer statistics on how policies affect the virus spread by the Change-point model

3. Create model for virus spread: Generative model (SEIRD) --> Simulation_and_Policy.ipynb

4. BONUS: Create a simulation game with imaginary world --> Simulation_and_Policy.ipynb
